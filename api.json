      "full": "Ghosts represent one of humanity's oldest and most universal paranormal beliefs, found in virtually every culture throughout history. The phenomenon encompasses alleged manifestations of deceased individuals including visual apparitions, disembodied voices, unexplained sounds, cold spots, object movement, and electromagnetic disturbances. Hauntings are categorized as intelligent (interactive spirits) or residual (recordings of past events). Investigation methods have evolved from spiritualist seances to modern equipment-based approaches using EMF detectors, thermal cameras, and audio recorders. Despite widespread belief and thousands of reported experiences, no scientific evidence has definitively confirmed ghostly existence."
